# NetLet

Kuwait-first marketplace storefront. React + Vite client, Express + tRPC server,
Shopify for catalog and checkout, Postgres for accounts.

## Design reference

`almailgroup/netlet-old-design`, branch `claude/shiplee-tracking-website` — an
earlier vanilla HTML/CSS build of NetLet. Treat it as a source of design ideas,
not of code: it is a different stack and a different palette.

Read it for layout and treatment. Worth knowing what is in there:

- The glass is on the header _bar_, not just its controls:
  `rgba(247,246,242,0.75)` under `blur(25px) saturate(210%)`. More translucent
  and more saturated than the current header, which sits at 0.95.
- The mobile bottom bar floats with a 24px radius, an upward shadow, and
  `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)` — that last part is where the current mobile
  nav's home-indicator fix came from.

**Its palette is a different direction** — yellow `#FEEE00`, blue `#1E3A8A`,
soft orange `#ffa86e`. The current brand is navy `#0a285a`, orange `#f2683a`,
pearl `#f3f2ed`. Do not carry the old colours across without asking.

## Buttons

One rule, and it is easy to break by accident. The three filled tints
(`.glass-navy`, `.glass-accent`, `.glass-on-dark`) share a construction: solid
fill, a single hairline along the top edge, a soft inner shade at the bottom, a
restrained rim. **No diagonal wash and no hover sweep** — over a filled surface
those read as glare.

The clear tint (`.glass`) keeps both, because on a near-transparent surface they
are what makes the glass legible at all.

`backdrop-filter` on an opaque fill is wasted work; only the clear tint and
`.glass-field` carry it.

## Accounts

Registered accounts live in **Firebase Authentication** — the password, and
later the reset and verification flows that come with it. `users` in Postgres
keeps one mirror row per shopper, linked by `firebase_uid`, because saved
products, delivery area, notification preferences and order tracking are all
foreign keys to its serial `id`.

The password is checked server-side, through Identity Toolkit rather than the
Firebase Web SDK, so no Firebase code ships to the client and the session stays
the same httpOnly cookie. `docs/FIREBASE.md` is the setup.

With the four `FIREBASE_*` variables unset, the same endpoints fall back to the
local scrypt digest in `password_hash`. Exactly one of the two is set on any
given account.

## Languages

The storefront ships in English and Arabic, from one dictionary in
`shared/i18n/dictionary.ts`. `ar` is typed as a complete record of the English
keys, so a missing translation is a type error rather than an English word
appearing mid-Arabic-sentence; `shared/i18n/dictionary.test.ts` also fails on an
Arabic entry that is still a copy of the English, or that has drifted from its
`{placeholder}` set.

Two rules keep the RTL layout honest:

- **No physical direction utilities in page code.** `ms-`/`me-`/`ps-`/`pe-`/
  `start-`/`end-`/`text-start`/`border-s`. `left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2` is the
  exception — it centres, it does not take a side. The unused shadcn primitives
  under `components/ui/` are left as they came.
- **Arrows and chevrons that mean "onward" carry `rtl:-scale-x-100`.** So do
  the gradients and masks that shade toward the text, or the Arabic headline
  ends up sitting on the bright side of the hero.

Merchant data (product titles, spec rows) is in whatever language the merchant
typed. Specification rows and description text carry `dir="auto"` so each takes
its own direction and the punctuation lands on the right side.

## Deploys

Pages serves `main` at `/` — "Deploy from a branch", one branch only. The
workflow builds and commits the result back into `main`, so its deploy commits
land on the branch you are working on: expect to rebase.

Two traps:

- The base path is derived from the repository name at build time. A rename
  moves the Pages URL, and a build carrying the old name loads to a blank page.
- The deploy commit carries a skip-ci marker. Do not write that marker verbatim
  in an ordinary commit message — GitHub matches it anywhere in the message and
  will skip the build.

## Demo mode

`VITE_DEMO_MODE=true` builds a version with no backend: `client/src/lib/demoLink.ts`
answers every tRPC procedure from fixtures in `demoCatalog.ts`. That is what the
Pages site runs. **The catalog is invented** — sample products and prices, with
nothing on the page saying so since the preview banner was removed.

## iOS app

`ios-app/` is the whole iOS side: the Expo source, the artwork, and the
generated Xcode project in `ios-app/ios/`, which is committed so it opens from
a clone. It is a WebView shell around the published Pages site, so it needs no
backend running.

`ios/` is generated from `app.json` by `npx expo prebuild` — hand edits to the
Xcode project are lost the next time that runs. `ios-app/README.md` has the
run steps and what is deliberately not committed.

Expo Go cannot run it: three of its modules ship native code. `npx expo run:ios`
is the way in.

## Checks

`pnpm check` · `pnpm test` · `pnpm build`. Data-layer tests run against a real
Postgres in-process via PGlite, applying the generated migration verbatim, so
`ON CONFLICT` arbiters and enum types are genuinely exercised.

Configuration lives in `.env.example`, annotated with what each value switches
off — nothing throws at boot, so a missing value shows up as a dead feature.
