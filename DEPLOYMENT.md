# Running NetLet on the Mac mini

This is the guide for putting the real storefront online: the Express + tRPC
server, talking to Shopify for the catalog and Postgres for accounts, served
from a Mac mini.

## Why this is needed at all

The GitHub Pages site is **not** this. Pages serves static files and cannot run
a server, so the Pages build sets `VITE_DEMO_MODE=true` and answers every tRPC
call in the browser from invented fixtures (`client/src/lib/demoCatalog.ts`).
It never reaches Shopify — it never makes a network request at all.

The Shopify Storefront token is read server-side (`SHOPIFY_*`, never
`VITE_SHOPIFY_*`) because anything with a `VITE_` prefix is inlined into the
browser bundle and would be public. So the chain is:

```
Shopify  ->  this server (Mac mini)  ->  shopper's browser
```

Until the middle link is running, adding products in Shopify changes nothing on
the live site.

## What the Mac mini needs

| | |
|---|---|
| Node | 20 or newer (`node --version`) |
| pnpm | `corepack enable && corepack prepare pnpm@latest --activate` |
| Always on | Sleep disabled, or the shop is down whenever it sleeps |
| Postgres | Only for accounts. Browsing, cart and checkout work without it. |

Disable sleep — a sleeping Mac mini is an offline shop:

```sh
sudo pmset -a sleep 0 disksleep 0
sudo pmset -a autorestart 1   # come back up after a power cut
```

## 1. Configure

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

Fill in the two Storefront values. `.env.example` documents every other
setting and what breaks without it. Nothing throws at boot when a value is
missing — an unset variable shows up as a dead feature, not an error — so it is
worth reading.

```sh
SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN=yourshop.myshopify.com          # no https://, no trailing slash
SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_API_ACCESS_TOKEN=...
```

The token comes from Shopify admin → Settings → Apps and sales channels →
Develop apps → your app → Configuration → **Storefront API** — not the Admin
API. It needs:

- `unauthenticated_read_product_listings`
- `unauthenticated_read_product_inventory`
- `unauthenticated_write_checkouts`

`.env` is gitignored. Keep it that way; the token is a credential.

## 2. Check the connection before building anything

```sh
pnpm shopify:probe
```

This calls the real Storefront API and prints what came back. It exits non-zero
if the catalog is unusable, so it is the fastest way to tell a wrong token from
an empty store:

- exit 2 — the variables are not set
- an error naming the domain — wrong `SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN`
- `401`/`403` — wrong token, or an Admin token used by mistake
- `received 0 product(s)` — the credentials work, but no product is published
  to the Storefront API. In Shopify each product needs its sales channel set to
  include the app the token belongs to. This is the most common surprise.

## 3. Build and run

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm build          # client into dist/public, server into dist/index.js
pnpm start          # serves the API and the built site on PORT (default 3000)
```

Then `http://localhost:3000` on the Mac mini itself should show real products.

`PORT` is honoured exactly in production. If it is taken the server exits with
a message rather than quietly moving to the next free port — a port that drifts
out from under a tunnel is an outage that leaves a healthy-looking process
behind.

## 4. Keep it running

`pnpm start` dies with the terminal. launchd restarts it on crash and on boot.
Write `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.netlet.storefront.plist`, replacing the two
paths:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN"
  "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
  <key>Label</key>            <string>com.netlet.storefront</string>
  <key>WorkingDirectory</key> <string>/Users/YOU/NetLet-web-app</string>
  <key>ProgramArguments</key>
  <array>
    <string>/usr/local/bin/node</string>
    <string>/Users/YOU/NetLet-web-app/dist/index.js</string>
  </array>
  <key>EnvironmentVariables</key>
  <dict>
    <key>NODE_ENV</key> <string>production</string>
    <key>PORT</key>     <string>3000</string>
  </dict>
  <key>RunAtLoad</key>   <true/>
  <key>KeepAlive</key>   <true/>
  <key>StandardOutPath</key>   <string>/Users/YOU/Library/Logs/netlet.log</string>
  <key>StandardErrorPath</key> <string>/Users/YOU/Library/Logs/netlet.error.log</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

`which node` gives the path for `ProgramArguments` — under Homebrew on Apple
silicon it is `/opt/homebrew/bin/node`, not `/usr/local/bin/node`.

```sh
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.netlet.storefront.plist
launchctl list | grep netlet          # third column 0 means running
tail -f ~/Library/Logs/netlet.error.log
```

The server reads `.env` from its working directory, which is why
`WorkingDirectory` is set. After changing `.env`:

```sh
launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.netlet.storefront
```

## 5. Put it on the internet

The Mac mini is behind a home router with a changing IP, so port forwarding is
the fragile option. Cloudflare Tunnel makes an outbound connection instead — no
static IP, no ports opened on the router, and TLS handled for you.

```sh
brew install cloudflared
cloudflared tunnel login
cloudflared tunnel create netlet
cloudflared tunnel route dns netlet shop.yourdomain.com
```

`~/.cloudflared/config.yml`:

```yaml
tunnel: netlet
credentials-file: /Users/YOU/.cloudflared/<tunnel-id>.json
ingress:
  - hostname: shop.yourdomain.com
    service: http://localhost:3000
  - service: http_status:404
```

```sh
cloudflared service install     # survives reboot
```

## 6. Accounts (optional, later)

Browsing, cart and checkout all work as a guest without a database. Sign-in,
saved items, delivery preference and order tracking are what stay dark.

To switch them on, set `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` and create the tables:

```sh
pnpm db:push
pnpm db:studio    # browse the tables in a browser
```

## Deploying an update

```sh
git pull
pnpm install
pnpm build
launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.netlet.storefront
```

## When something is wrong

| Symptom | Cause |
|---|---|
| `Shopify Storefront API is not configured` | `.env` not loaded — check `WorkingDirectory`, then `launchctl kickstart` |
| Site loads, no products | Products not published to the token's sales channel — `pnpm shopify:probe` confirms |
| `Could not find the build directory` | `pnpm build` has not run since the last pull |
| Works locally, not through the domain | Tunnel down (`cloudflared tunnel info netlet`) or pointed at the wrong port |
| Site dead after a reboot | plist not loaded, or the Mac mini slept — see the `pmset` commands above |

## Once this is live

The demo catalog exists only for the Pages preview. When the Mac mini is
serving real products, `client/src/lib/demoCatalog.ts` and `demoLink.ts` can be
deleted along with `VITE_DEMO_MODE` — nothing else references them.
