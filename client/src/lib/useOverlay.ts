/**
 * The behaviour every overlay is expected to have, in one place.
 *
 * A drawer, a dialog and a bottom sheet all owe the person who opened them the
 * same three things, and NetLet's were each missing a different one:
 *
 *   - Escape closes it. Reaching for the mouse to leave a panel you opened with
 *     a keystroke is the kind of small friction that makes software feel
 *     unfinished.
 *   - Focus goes back where it came from. Without this, closing a drawer
 *     drops the keyboard at the top of the document and a shopper has to tab
 *     through the whole header to get back to the product they were looking at.
 *   - The page behind stops scrolling. A sheet that scrolls the catalog under
 *     itself loses the shopper's place while they are ticking a filter.
