# NetLet — iOS app

Everything for the iOS app lives in this one folder.

```
ios-app/
├── App.tsx          the app itself
├── src/             the contract with the web storefront
├── assets/          icon and splash artwork
├── ios/             the native Xcode project  ← open this in Xcode
├── app.json         Expo config: name, icon, splash, bundle identifier
└── package.json
```

## What the app is

A native shell around the NetLet storefront. It loads
`https://almailgroup.github.io/NetLet-Website/` in a `WKWebView` and adds the
things a website cannot do: a native tab bar, haptics, and the iOS glass effect.
`src/webStorefront.ts` holds the values shared with the web side — change a tab
label there and it must change on the web too, or that tab silently stops
working.

It does **not** need the Mac mini server running. It points at the published
site, so it shows real content the moment it launches.

## Run it

You need a Mac with Xcode, and CocoaPods (`brew install cocoapods`).

```sh
cd ios-app
npm install
npx expo run:ios
```

That builds and opens the simulator. First run takes 5–15 minutes while it
compiles the native modules; after that it is fast.

To work in Xcode instead — for signing, device testing, or native debugging:

```sh
cd ios-app/ios
pod install
open NetLet.xcworkspace
```

Pick a simulator in the toolbar and press ▶.

**Open `NetLet.xcworkspace`, not `NetLet.xcodeproj`.** The `.xcodeproj` is
checked in; the `.xcworkspace` is written by `pod install` and is the one that
includes the pods. Opening the project directly gives a build full of
missing-module errors.

## Why not Expo Go

Expo Go only carries the native modules built into it. This app uses
`react-native-webview`, `expo-glass-effect` and `react-native-view-shot`, which
all ship their own native iOS code, so it has to be built — which is exactly
what `npx expo run:ios` does.

## What is committed, and what is not

`ios/` is committed so the project opens in Xcode straight from a clone.
`ios/Pods/`, `ios/*.xcworkspace` and `xcuserdata/` are not: CocoaPods and Xcode
regenerate them, and Pods alone is around 100MB of vendored source.

`ios/` is generated from `app.json` by `npx expo prebuild`. Editing the Xcode
project by hand works until someone re-runs prebuild, which overwrites it —
change `app.json` instead, and re-run:

```sh
npx expo prebuild --platform ios --clean
```

## On a real iPhone

Open the workspace, select the **NetLet** target → Signing & Capabilities, tick
*Automatically manage signing*, and pick your Apple ID under Team. A free
account works; the build expires after seven days and is reinstalled by running
again. Then choose your iPhone in the toolbar instead of a simulator.

## Checks

```sh
npm run check          # TypeScript
npm test               # unit tests
npx expo export --platform ios   # confirms the JS bundle builds
```
