/**
 * Firebase Authentication: where NetLet's registered accounts actually live.
 *
 * Firebase owns the credential — the email, the password, and everything that
 * comes with it later (reset links, verification, a second factor, Google
 * sign-in). NetLet keeps a mirror row per shopper so that saved products,
 * delivery area and notification preferences can go on being ordinary foreign
 * keys instead of documents.
 *
 * The password is checked on the server, not in the browser. The Admin SDK
 * cannot verify a password, so sign-in goes through Identity Toolkit's
 * `signInWithPassword` with the project's Web API key — which is a public
 * identifier, not a secret. Keeping it here rather than in the client means the
 * page never holds a Firebase token, and the session stays the httpOnly cookie
 * the rest of the server already understands.
 *
 * Everything degrades: with no credentials configured `getFirebaseAuth()`
 * answers null and the caller falls back to the local password table, in
 * keeping with the rest of this server's configuration.
